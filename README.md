Location is a crucial factor of retail success, as 94% of retail sales are
still transacted in physical stores. To increase the chance of success for
their stores, business owners require not only the knowledge of where
their potential customers are, but also of their surrounding competitors
and complementary businesses. From the property owner’s standpoint, it
is also important to assess the potential success values of their property
locations so as to determine the appropriate businesses to lease the
locations to and for the right amounts. However, assessing and picking a
store location is a cumbersome task for both business and property
owners. To carry out the above tasks well, many factors need to be
taken into account, each of which requires gathering and analyzing the
relevant data. Traditionally, business and property owners conduct
surveys to assess the value of store locations. Such surveys, however,
are costly and do not scale up well. With fast changing environments
(e.g., neighborhood rental, local population size, composition, etc.) and
emergence of new business locations, one also needs to continuously
re-evaluate the value of store locations.
Fortunately, in the era of social media and mobile apps, we have an
abundance of online user-generated data, which capture both activities
of users in social media as well as offline activities at physical locations.
Facebook is one of the world’s largest social media platforms, with more
than 1 billion active users everyday. From the business standpoint, the
massive availability of user, location, and other behavioral data in
Facebook is attractive, and has changed the way people do businesses.
For instance, many small/medium business owners are now setting up
Facebook Pages to:
(i) allow customers to find their businesses on Facebook
(ii) connect with customers via “likes” and “check-ins”
(iii) reach out to more customers through advertising their business
pages on Facebook
(iv) conduct analytics of their pages to get a deeper understanding
of their customers and marketing activities.
Consumers are also adapting both their online and offline behaviors to
the introduction of Facebook Pages for businesses. Other than “liking”
businesses on their Facebook Pages, they can do a “check-in” whenever
they physically visit the respective business stores. Facebook Pages
have turned many offline signals into online behavior that can be
analyzed for business insights. In particular, features such as “likes” and
“check-ins” can be used as indicators of popularity, and by extension,
success. Similarly, Instagram, Twitter, and Foursquare also have
variants of these quantitative signals that can be retrieved from their
geotagged photos, tweets, and tips. These data allow us to study the
dynamics of brick-and-mortar stores and discover meaningful patterns
and insights that will help retail and property owners make better
decisions.
